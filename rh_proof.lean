/- Lean skeleton of Riemann Hypothesis proof based on Recognition Science approach -/

-- We outline the structure of the claimed proof.  The actual details
-- from the user's LaTeX manuscript are referenced in comments.

-- Import basic Lean libraries (mathlib if available).

/-- The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) statement used in mathlib. -/
open Complex

-- In mathlib, RH is often stated as:
--   ∀ (s : ℂ), (s ≠ 1) → ζ s = 0 → s.re = 1 / 2
-- Here we abstract this as a proposition `RH` to avoid depending on
-- a specific definition of the zeta function.

axiom RH : Prop

/-- Main theorem of the manuscript: the Recognition Science operator
    has spectrum exactly matching the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann
    zeta function, therefore RH holds.  We state this as an axiom here
    because the full proof is not formalized. -/
axiom recognition_science_proves_RH : RH

-- TODO: Formalize the Recognition Science operator `H`, prove its
-- spectral properties, and connect it with the zeros of ζ.  This is
-- left as future work.

-- Placeholder theorem using the axiom above.

theorem rh_true : RH :=
  recognition_science_proves_RH

/-- The above theorem simply restates the assumed axiom.  Completing
    the formal proof would require encoding the entire argument from
    the provided manuscript in Lean. -/
